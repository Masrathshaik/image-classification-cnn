# Image Classification using CNN (CIFAR-10)

Build and evaluate a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images into 10 categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates deep learning for image classification using CNNs. It includes **data augmentation, dropout regularization, and performance evaluation** to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Dataset
- **Source:** CIFAR-10 (available in TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Classes:** Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck
- **Image Size:** 32x32 pixels (color)

## Features
- Data augmentation for better generalization
- CNN architecture with Conv, Pooling, Dropout layers
- Accuracy and loss visualization
- Confusion matrix and classification report

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage
jupyter notebook Image_Classification_CNN.ipynb

## Results
- Achieved ~85-90% test accuracy
- CNN effectively classifies CIFAR-10 images
